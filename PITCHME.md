### Gilded Rose 
- is a coding kata, which are exercises to improve your skills as a programmer

---

### Step 1
Understand the requirements

+++

- Read the requirements:
  - https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt
- Understand the code you have to work with:
  - https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/Java/src/main/java/com/gildedrose
  - You may clone the repository here: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata and go to the **Java** folder to view existing code.

+++

### Split into groups and discuss what the goal of the exercise is.

---

### Step 2
Draw the decision tree flow chart

+++

- From the requirements, use https://www.draw.io/ OR https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor to draw the if-else decision tree flow chart

---

### Step 2.5
Use the Golden Master approach to ensure changes you make will not break the existing code

+++

The Golden Master can be used when you know what the expected output is
- Using the legacy code, you can generate the correct expected results for each day
- Future changes you make to the legacy code should still provide the same output.
- If they differ, that would mean that the code is incorrect and requires fixing

---

### Step 3
Refactor the existing code

---

### Step 3.5
Implement the Conjured item

---

### Step 4
Use Google Sheet to identify the **difference** and **similarities** between each item

+++

- Aged Brie
- Backstage Pass
- Legendary
- Conjured

---

### Step 5
Use Inheritance and other OOP concepts to refactor the existing code

---

### Step 6
Implement the Conjured Item category
